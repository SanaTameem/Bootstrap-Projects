- To use bootstrap we have to download the compiled CSS and JS from getbootstrap.com website and import the bootstrap.css or bootstrap.min.css and bootstrap.bundle.js or bootstrap.bundle.min.js to our project directory.
Then for linking the css in the head of our html file we should write :
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min.css"> 
For linking the JS before the closing body tag we should write : 
<script src="js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
