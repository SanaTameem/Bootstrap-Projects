## Getting Started:

To use Bootstrap, download the compiled CSS and JS files from [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Then, import the `bootstrap.min.css` or `bootstrap.css` and `bootstrap.bundle.min.js` or `bootstrap.bundle.js` files into your project directory.
<br><br>
Link the CSS in the `<head>` of your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min.css" />
```

And include the JS files before the closing `</body>` tag:

```
<script src="js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

Or we can use :

```
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-YvpcrYf0tY3lHB60NNkmXc5s9fDVZLESaAA55NDzOxhy9GkcIdslK1eN7N6jIeHz" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

## What is SAAS?
Sass is a CSS pre-processor scripting language that adds extra features to CSS and is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
Sass files can have either .scss or .sass extensions.

Here are some key features of Sass:
- Variables : Sass allows you to define variables to store colors, fonts, and any other values that you reuse throughout your stylesheet.

- Nestings : You can nest CSS selectors within one another, which helps in writing cleaner and more readable code, especially when dealing with complex CSS structures.

- Mixings : Mixins are reusable blocks of styles that can be included in other selectors. They can also accept arguments, making them versatile for creating variations of styles.

- Imports : Sass allows you to break your CSS code into smaller, modular files called partials, and then import them into one master stylesheet.

- Inheritance (Extend): Sass supports inheritance of styles using @extend, which allows one selector to inherit styles from another selector.

- Operators : Sass supports several operators that allow you to perform operations on values and variables within your stylesheets. These operators include arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

- Conditionals : Sass provides conditional statements (@if, @else if, @else) that allow you to apply styles based on conditions.

- Modularity & Reusability : Sass encourages modularity and reusability through several features.
